# Coffee Supply Chain Tracking System based on Ethereum Blockchain

This application is meant to track a coffee supply chain and it's based on Ethereum blockchain. In order to develop smart contracts, Truffle framework was used. In truffle-config.js script is established both Ethereum' network conecctions, one for a local network using Ganache tool from the Truffle Suite and the other one for Ropsten' testnet. Smart contracts deployed on Ropsten' testnet can be seen on: [SupplyChainStorage smart contract](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x531df0B1CA9eb44AC3B7833085FBDcADFd8E6eE8), [SupplyChainUser](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x96F08c7E04324E98af8d2884f384e976a67B345F), [CoffeeSupplyChain](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x474488194eA9A74Ea18F37220C2E19ca050deeF4).

The following flowchart explains logic of the application transferred to the developed smart contracts. All smart contracts were tested on local network.
